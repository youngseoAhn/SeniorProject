    What is Mental Health?
</h1>

<p1 class='MHis'>
    Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act, 
    and helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices.
<br></br>
    Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood. Over the course of your life, 
    if you experience mental health problems, your thinking, mood, and behavior could be affected.

<h5 class='SMI'>
    A Serious Mental Illness (SMI) is a mental illness that interferes with a person’s life and ability to function. 
    Despite common misperceptions, having an SMI is not a choice, a weakness, or a character flaw. 
    <br></br>
    It is not something that just “passes” or can be “snapped out of” with willpower.
